WebSite-Specific Smart Search App
Requirements Document & Project Plan

1. Overview
A cross-platform web search application that allows users to search within a specific website (entered by the user), delivering highly relevant and user-friendly results. The app should offer advanced features like keyword highlighting, filtering, and AI-based suggestions, with a simple, intuitive user interface optimized for all devices.


2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Website-Specific Search
Users can input a URL and a search query. The system performs a search only within the provided website. Results will be ranked by relevance, prioritizing title match, keyword density, and semantic similarity.

2.2 Search Result Display
Results include: Title, Snippet/summary, URL. Searched keywords are highlighted in the results.

2.3 Filtering Options
Filters based on: Date (e.g., last week, month, year), Content type (articles, PDFs, images), Keyword category.

2.4 AI-Driven Suggestions
Suggested queries based on user's search history, most searched terms, and semantic expansion.

2.5 Platform Support
Mobile apps for iOS and Android. Web app as responsive standalone site. Device compatibility across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

2.6 User Interface
Simple and minimalist design. Home screen with search bar and optional filters. Search results page with fast loading. Optional dark/light mode support.


3. Non-Functional Requirements
• Performance: Search results in under 2 seconds (typical case)
• Scalability: Support at least 10,000 concurrent users
• Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
• Security: HTTPS-only, no user data logging unless opted in
• Language: English (Phase 1), future localization possible


4. BDD Feature Scenarios (Sample)
Feature: Search Specific Website
Scenario: User searches a specific website for a keyword Given the user has entered "https://example.com" into the site field And the user has entered "quantum energy" into the search field When the user clicks "Search" Then the app should return results only from "https://example.com" And the results should highlight the keyword "quantum energy"

Feature: Show AI Suggestions
Scenario: User starts typing a query Given the user is on the search screen When the user types "quant" Then te app should display suggestions like "quantum energy", "quantum computing
